# functional-javascript-tutorial
In this friendly introduction to functional programming with JavaScript, you'll learn what Functional Programming (FP) is and how it differs from other programming styles (such as OO and imperative). You'll practice the key idea of doing everything with pure functions, learning to use higher-order functions and recursion to replace the iterative loops we're used to writing with for and while. You'll more to advanced techniques like closures, currying, and function composition and learn why immutable data is essential for functional programming.

# Introduction
* This will help you understand basic concepts of Functional Programming
* Core Ideas to get started as Functional Programmers

Different programming paradigmns are really interesting to me. We will be noob functional programmers.

## What we will learn?
* What is a functional programming?
* What does it mean to do functional programming?
* What does functional code look like?
* What tools do we need to write functional programs?

JavaScript is not considered a great functional language but its great to learn functional programming.

## Concepts
* Pure functions
* Side effects
* Programs as pipelines where data flows
* Higher order functions
* First class functions
* Currying
* Closure
* Immutability, changing data so it works with functional programming

We are focused on JavaScript. Focus on concepts.
