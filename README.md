# functional-javascript-tutorial
In this friendly introduction to functional programming with JavaScript, you'll learn what Functional Programming (FP) is and how it differs from other programming styles (such as OO and imperative). You'll practice the key idea of doing everything with pure functions, learning to use higher-order functions and recursion to replace the iterative loops we're used to writing with for and while. You'll more to advanced techniques like closures, currying, and function composition and learn why immutable data is essential for functional programming.

# Introduction
* This will help you understand basic concepts of Functional Programming
* Core Ideas to get started as Functional Programmers

Different programming paradigmns are really interesting to me. We will be noob functional programmers.

## What we will learn?
* What is a functional programming?
* What does it mean to do functional programming?
* What does functional code look like?
* What tools do we need to write functional programs?

JavaScript is not considered a great functional language but its great to learn functional programming.

## Concepts
* Pure functions
* Side effects
* Programs as pipelines where data flows
* Higher order functions
* First class functions
* Currying
* Closure
* Immutability, changing data so it works with functional programming

We are focused on JavaScript. Focus on concepts.

## What is functional programming?
* buzz words and concepts
* Keywords: stateless, compose, pure, functor, monad, curry, side effect, lazy, monoid, immutable, higher-order, referential transparecy
* It is a style of programming
* JS - does not get described as a functional language
* Learning FP(functional programming) made me a better JS developer once I learnt basic FP
* A programming paradigm (world view/mindset) - what things are in it and how they interact?

### Other paradigms
* Imperative - Follow my commands and do that
* Declarative - I want to do it that way but its up to you
* Object Oriented - managing state, inheritance
* Functional: SINGLE Thing - pure functions - only input in and only output out
Turn iterations of lists into maps and reduces
Think of the race. Break code into functions. Make those functions functional. Turn a loop that repeats a process into a recursion.
Think of the bands. Turn a sequence of operations into a pipeline.

## Pure Functions
### only input in ---> only output out
* A pure function is a function
* It only takes the input in and returns output
* Apart from the input id does not touch any data

Example of Input-Output
